                <h2>1. Who critiqued my work?</h2>


				<p> For my final project, I chose to modify my Every Picture project because it's an interesting project to me and I would like to explore more about photo and positioning techniques to make the website looks more smoothly. </p> 
                          
				
                <h2>Design critique notes: </h2>

             
                <p>My main focus is going to be on improving the visual design of the project. For iteration, I will adjust the flowing motion of each image since they’re all floating at the same direction and at the same time. Secondly, I will adjust the image flipping functions to make it flip first  </p>
