			<h1>Final Project Brief</h1>

            <article>

                <h2>Project Summary:</h2>


				<p> For my final project, I chose to modify my Every Picture project because it's an interesting project to me and I would like to explore more about photo and positioning techniques to make the website looks more smoothly. </p> 
                          
				
                <h2>Project Description: </h2>

             
                <p>My main focus is going to be on improving the visual design of the project. For iteration, I will adjust the flowing motion of each image since theyâ€™re all floating at the same direction and at the same time. Secondly, I will adjust the image flipping functions to make it flip first and then reveal itself instead of the current situation of revealing itself first and then flipping it. Thirdly, I will also fix the background for my modal, I will likely make the background darker and more late-night theme-related. Last but not least, I will make minor animations for my background, for example: creating a gif background of shooting stars or making the stars somehow shift and move in the bacckground to create a more lively late-night vibe. </p>

           
                <h2>Expert Feedback:</h2>

				<p> For expert feedback, I might reach out to the TA or the undergraduate tutor for to seek more creative ideas regarding how to improve the visual design of my website. Additionally, I plan to reach out to one of my friend that studies deisgn computing at an university at Melbourne, I think she could provide me helpful feedback since she's been working along with website related projects too. </p>
