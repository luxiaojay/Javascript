                            After reading the article about Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows, as a user, I think it’s crucial to have an “escape hatch” as the article mentioned, which allows the users to know that they have options and a way to exit and close the modal. Secondly, I think it’s also crucial to have a descriptive title in order to inform the users what the main purpose of the pop-up modal is about or else the users would tend to feel confused or even frustrated when the modal shows up, but doesn’t indicate a title. Speaking of which, I agree with what the author mention of allowing the users to prompt the modal with clicking button or following a link instead of popping up a modal out of no where since it could surprise the users and cause them to cancel the modal faster. </p> 

                            <p>Overall, I think this is a useful article because I never thought of these small details and features of a modal. After reading this article, it has definitely benefited me in terms of designing the website since modal tends to be common on a website.</p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>

                            After reading the article about form design, I can't agree more with the information being presented on the website. There are so many small details to pay attention to and the surprising psychological aspects that were considered behind every elements  on the website. As someone who is interested in UI/UX, these are very useful areas and tips to pay attention to in order for the users to have a more pleasing experience. I never thought of the need to put the default placeholder text (hint or example) beneath the placeholder. Another useful design that I learned is the importance to provide an overall steps of the whole process to complete the form, so the users are aware how much left for them to complete the form and could increase form completion.</p>

                            One example website that I interacted that exemplifies best practices is LinkedIn’s login page. The login page is straightforward and with only 2 areas like email and password to fill in on the first page, which allows the users to feel less stressful and complicated towards the process. Additionally, the password also have the “show” function for a clear feedback to the users.
