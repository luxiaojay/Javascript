                            After reading the article about form design, I can't agree more with the information being presented on the website. There are so many small details to pay attention to and the surprising psychological aspects that were considered behind every elements  on the website. As someone who is interested in UI/UX, these are very useful areas and tips to pay attention to in order for the users to have a more pleasing experience. I never thought of the need to put the default placeholder text (hint or example) beneath the placeholder. Another useful design that I learned is the importance to provide an overall steps of the whole process to complete the form, so the users are aware how much left for them to complete the form and could increase form completion.</p>

                            One example website that I interacted that exemplifies best practices is LinkedIn’s login page. The login page is straightforward and with only 2 areas like email and password to fill in on the first page, which allows the users to feel less stressful and complicated towards the process. Additionally, the password also have the “show” function for a clear feedback to the users.
