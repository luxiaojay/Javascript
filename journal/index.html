                            Right when I read the first point that the author mentioned, which is having the important buttons on the comfort-to-reach area of the device. I personally feel relatable to this issue since I remember playing games and I need to lift up my left hand to hold the phone, so I can press the button. However, I encountered a shooting game where they allow you to customize and move the button to anywhere on the screen that matches your preferences and comfort. Additionally, I think it’s very smart that they utilize this tip to put monetize, like stores and ads. </p> 

                        <p>
                            Another tip he mentioned that I think it’s so accurate is how the rating page should appear after the user gets satisfied at some point of the game, like when they win the game or when they complete a mission. I agree with this strategy since I would likely to give positive feedback and not skip the rating.
</p>

                        <p>
                            I think this article is so helpful since someone who has experience with 250+ games organized these such useful and beneficial tips, so you don’t have to figure it out yourself and spent you a huge amount of time. </p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

                <p class="date">02/13/2024</p>

                <figure>
                    <img src="images/food1.jpg" alt="noodles" width="250" height="400"> 
                    <figcaption>Photo by Yi-Chun Lu, 2024</figcaption>
                </figure>
        
             
                <p>This image is interesting because it’s food and it looks yummy  just by looking at it. Some non-asian people might not know much about this type of food and they are likely to make interesting guesses and assumptions towards the food depicted in the image. This image relates to my topic of my collection of food that I eat during midnight. It's one of the picture and there will be 5 different images of food. I’m a boring person that doesn’t have a hobby of collecting certain stuff. However, when I scroll through my phone, most of the pictures I see are food and typically food that I ate during midnight when I can’t sleep.  This is something I get in touch often and that’s what makes happy and complete throughout the day. </p>

                    <img src="images/partnerpic.JPG" alt="partnerpic" width="250" height="300">

                </figure>                

             
                <p>From exchanging image with another classmate, her image is about a cartoon character that seems like a narcissist that fantasizes himself. I feel like the most interesting aspect of this image is how my classmate uses elements like big and bubbly eyes, roses and sparkles to effectively help convey the whole mood and message of the image. The most obvious thing is his face which straight up conveys the emotions that he is obsessed with himself. The most mysterious aspect of this image is that it would make me feel interested and curious about the context and story, like what happened that caused the cartoon character to have that type of emotion and would like to explore more with the story.</p>

                <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>

                <p class="date">02/08/2024</p>


						<p>
                            I’ve never knew the term “visual thinking skills” and how this is type of powerful skill any individual could have. After reading the article, I realize this skill is crucial and how this activity could be very interesting by exploring and exchanging unique perspectives with other people. </p> 

                        <p>
                            One of the example on the website where a man is drowning in the sewer, as I read through an example of someone’s interpretation towards the picture, I immediately was confused and shook my head and had thoughts that it’s not possible. Therefore, I think it’s interesting how everyone would definitely have different and unique observations and interpretations , so that’s why the article stress about the importance of practicing visual thinking strategies.</p>

                        <p>
                            Additionally, I never thought pf practicing visual thinking strategies can help us in writing as a teacher mentioned in the article. However, I agree with this reason since it would help strengthen an individuals skills in looking into smaller details and extracting from those observations to make interpretation and analysis, which could form reasonable conclusion. </p>

                <h2>Overlays Design</h2>

                <p class="date">01/31/2024</p>


						<p>
                            After reading the article about Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows, as a user, I think it’s crucial to have an “escape hatch” as the article mentioned, which allows the users to know that they have options and a way to exit and close the modal. Secondly, I think it’s also crucial to have a descriptive title in order to inform the users what the main purpose of the pop-up modal is about or else the users would tend to feel confused or even frustrated when the modal shows up, but doesn’t indicate a title. Speaking of which, I agree with what the author mention of allowing the users to prompt the modal with clicking button or following a link instead of popping up a modal out of no where since it could surprise the users and cause them to cancel the modal faster. </p> 

                            <p>Overall, I think this is a useful article because I never thought of these small details and features of a modal. After reading this article, it has definitely benefited me in terms of designing the website since modal tends to be common on a website.</p>

                <h2>Form Design</h2>

                <p class="date">01/24/2024</p>


						<p>
                            After reading the article about form design, I can't agree more with the information being presented on the website. There are so many small details to pay attention to and the surprising psychological aspects that were considered behind every elements  on the website. As someone who is interested in UI/UX, these are very useful areas and tips to pay attention to in order for the users to have a more pleasing experience. I never thought of the need to put the default placeholder text (hint or example) beneath the placeholder. Another useful design that I learned is the importance to provide an overall steps of the whole process to complete the form, so the users are aware how much left for them to complete the form and could increase form completion.</p>

                        <p class="exampleWebsite">
                            One example website that I interacted that exemplifies best practices is LinkedIn’s login page. The login page is straightforward and with only 2 areas like email and password to fill in on the first page, which allows the users to feel less stressful and complicated towards the process. Additionally, the password also have the “show” function for a clear feedback to the users.
